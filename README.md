## Overview
This is a design for a unique social media notifucation page component.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
First come proper planning of how the layout should go.
The designs are very similar since the main content's width only need to keep increasing until it gets to a point where it just remains centered as the viewport's width increases.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5.0.2](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
In the process of developing, I got expose to more bootstrap utility classes.
Also, I begin to feel the spirit of good designing surging in me ^_^
Added sizing and hover effect with css, relying on bootstrap for the layout.
